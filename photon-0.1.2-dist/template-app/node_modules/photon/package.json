  "readme": "# [Photon](http://photonkit.com/)\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/connors/photon/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/connors/photon)\n\nUI toolkit for building desktop apps with Electron.\n\n## Getting started\n\n* Clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/connors/photon.git`\n* [Read the docs](http://photonkit.com) to learn about the components and how to get your new application started\n\nTake note that our master branch is our active, unstable development branch and that if you're looking to download a stable copy of the repo, check the [tagged downloads](https://github.com/connors/photon/tags).\n\n### What's included\n\nWithin the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets. You'll see something like this:\n\n```\nphoton/\n├── css/\n│   ├── photon.css\n├── fonts/\n│   ├── photon-entypo.eot\n│   ├── photon-entypo.svg\n│   ├── photon-entypo.ttf\n│   └── photon-entypo.woff\n└── template-app/\n    ├── js/\n    │   └── menu.js\n    ├── app.js\n    ├── index.html\n    └── package.json\n```\n\nWe provide compiled CSS (`photon.*`). We also include the Entypo fonts and a template Electron application for you to quickly get started.\n\n## Documentation\n\nPhoton's documentation is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <http://photonkit.com>. The docs may also be run locally.\n\n### Running documentation locally\n\n1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.5.x).\n  * **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial guide](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) to get Jekyll up and running without problems.\n2. Install the Ruby-based syntax highlighter, [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), with `gem install rouge`.\n3. From the root `/photon` directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.\n4. Open <http://localhost:4000> in your browser, and boom!\n\nLearn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease file a GitHub issue to [report a bug](https://github.com/connors/photon/issues). When reporting a bug, be sure to follow the [contributor guidelines](https://github.com/connors/photon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Development\n\n1. Install node dependencies: `npm install`.\n2. Open the example app: `npm start`.\n\nModifying source Sass files? Open a second Terminal tab and run `npm run build` to kick off a build of the compiled `photon.css`.\n\n## Versioning\n\nFor transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility, Photon is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines. Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to these rules whenever possible.\n\nReleases will be numbered with the following format:\n\n`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`\n\nAnd constructed with the following guidelines:\n\n* Breaking backward compatibility **bumps the major** while resetting minor and patch\n* New additions without breaking backward compatibility **bumps the minor** while resetting the patch\n* Bug fixes and misc changes **bumps only the patch**\n\nFor more information on SemVer, please visit <http://semver.org/>.\n\n## Maintainers\n\nConnor Sears\n\n* <https://twitter.com/connors>\n* <https://github.com/connors>\n\n## License\n\nCopyright @connors.
